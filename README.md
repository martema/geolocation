Simple geolocation code with Matlab

In this repository, it is possible to find a simple Matlab implementation of three different geolocation techniques for sensor networks: the Least Square algorithm (LS), the Gaussian Newton algorithm (GN), the DOA-based Factor Graph algorithm with Taylor Series expansion (TS-DOA FG) and the FG algorithm using the LS result as initial point.
